/* Main thread started
main
1 by main thread 

The join() method tells the main thread to wait for the thread referenced by thread to finish execution before continuing.
Since thread is a reference to the main thread itself, it essentially makes the main thread wait for itself to complete. 
This causes a deadlock, as the main thread can never complete while itâ€™s waiting for itself.
